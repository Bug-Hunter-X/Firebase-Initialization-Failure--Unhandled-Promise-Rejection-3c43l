# Firebase Initialization Failure

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when initializing Firebase in JavaScript applications: unhandled promise rejections during app setup.

The `firebaseBug.js` file contains code that incorrectly handles the initialization process, leading to a silent failure. The `firebaseSolution.js` file shows the correct approach, ensuring robust error handling and providing more informative feedback to the developer.

## Problem

The primary issue stems from not explicitly handling potential errors during the `initializeApp` call.  This can occur due to incorrect configuration, network issues, or other unforeseen circumstances. The application may appear to load correctly but will fail to interact with Firebase services.

## Solution

The solution involves using `.catch()` to handle any rejected promises during initialization.  This allows for proper logging of errors, providing valuable diagnostic information and preventing silent failures.  The solution also shows better ways to integrate Firebase services, providing clear examples of proper use.
